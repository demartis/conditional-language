## Overview

**Conditional Language Shortcodes** is the perfect companion for multilingual WordPress websites built with **Polylang** and **Redirection**.  

This plugin lets you **centralize shared content** on one page (e.g. `/en/mypage`) while showing **country-specific variations** â€” ideal for cases like **Australia**, **UK**, and **USA** where content differs only slightly.

Instead of duplicating pages, you manage all variants with clean shortcodes.

---

## Why Use It?

- **One page, multiple variations.**  
  Write shared content once, show different versions based on URL (e.g., `/gb/mypage-gb`).

  Pay attention to the syntax, the only recognized URLs are in the format `/[lang]/mypage-[lang]` 

- **Saves time and reduces clutter.**  
  Manage fewer pages even across many countries and languages.

- **Designed for Polylang + Redirection setups.**  
  Ideal when language switching is based on **region codes** (e.g. `gb`, `au`, `us`).

---

## How It Works

1. You centralize content in a single page like `/en/mypage`, with conditionals like:
   ```html
   [conditional_language]
     [if_lang code="gb"]Text for UK[/if_lang]
     [if_lang code="au"]Text for Australia[/if_lang]
     [otherwise]Default text[/otherwise]
   [/conditional_language]
   ```

2. Use the **Redirection** plugin in **Pass-through mode** to rewrite:
   ```regexp
   ^/([a-z]{2})/(.+)-\1(/)?$
   â†’ /en/$2
   ```
   
   So a user visiting `/gb/product-gb/` will be served `/en/product`, but see content tailored for `gb`.


3. (alternative) You might want to create different configs to manage multiple languages, the case of
   
   Australia, UK, and USA â†’ rendered as EN
   
   France, Canada â†’ rendered as FR

   In that case:
   ```regexp
   ^/(au|uk|us)/(.+)-\1(/)?$
   â†’ /en/$2
   
   
   ^/(fn|ca)/(.+)-\1(/)?$
   â†’ /fr/$2
   ```

## Shortcode Examples

### Single Language
```html
[if_lang code="us"]Content only for USA visitors[/if_lang]
```

### Multiple with Fallback
```html
[conditional_language]
  [if_lang code="gb"]UK-specific content[/if_lang]
  [if_lang code="au"]AU-specific content[/if_lang]
  [otherwise]Fallback for other countries[/otherwise]
[/conditional_language]
```

---

## Developer Function

Use in theme/plugin PHP code:
```php
if ( conditional_language_is( 'au' ) ) {
    // Do something for Australian visitors
}
```
